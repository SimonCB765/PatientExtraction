# PatientExtraction

## Input File Format
if the exact same condition name is used more than once, then the last one takes precedence
    all information from previous occurrences are removed
Codes ending in % are expanded to contain all child codes
Codes can have no full stops (e.g. 101) or full stops (e.g. 101..)
Can't combine full stops and %
Any number of restrictions can be provided, they will be ANDed together
Consecutive whitespace in the name will be converted to a single underscore
Multiple value and date range restrictions can be provided by having more than one line.
At least one whitespace character is needed as a separator between:

- The word MODE and the mode choice
- The word OUT and the output choices
- Each output choice
- To delimit the separate parts of the restrictions (e.g. between from and the first date)

\# Name of the condition
\> MODE {mode}
\> OUT {out}
\> {restriction}
^-?[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,5}(\\.*|%)$

{mode} should be one or more of the following separated by spaces (case insensitive):

- EARLIEST - Select the earliest non-negative indicator code for the condition.
- LAST - Select the most recent non-negative indicator code for the condition.
- ALL - (Default value) Select all non-negative indicator codes for the condition.
- MAX - Select the non-negative indicator code with the greatest associated value (value 1 (v) not value 2 (w)).
- MIN - Select the non-negative indicator code with the smallest associated value (value 1 (v) not value 2 (w)).

{out} should be one or more of the following separated by spaces (case insensitive):

- CODE - Output the selected code (if the ALL mode is used this will output an arbitrary code).
- COUNT - (Default value) Output the number of times the selected code was associated with the patient.
- DATE - Output the date when the selected code was associated with the patient (if the ALL mode is used this will output an arbitrary date).
- MAX - Output the maximum value (value 1 (v) not value 2 (w)) associated with the selected codes.
- MEAN - Output the mean value (value 1 (v) not value 2 (w)) associated with the selected codes.
- MIN - Output the minimum value (value 1 (v) not value 2 (w)) associated with the selected codes.
- VALUE - Output the value (value 1 (v) not value 2 (w)) associated with the selected code (if the ALL mode is used this will output an arbitrary value).

Each {restriction} line should contain one of (case insensitive):

- A date range in the form - from YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD
    - This will select patients between the two dates (inclusively)
    - The second date must be more recent than the first one (or absent to extract all information up to the present)
- A value range meeting the following criteria:
    - The expression is of the form
        - x OP value
        - value OP x OP value
    - x is a numeric value
    - OP can be one of <, <=, > or >=

Examples of valid codes:

- C10E
- -1sd..
- ABC%

## Generate Data Files
Config file needs to contain the following fields:

- SQLDataDirectory - The directory where the SQL dumps are.
- FlatFileDirectory - The directory where the flat file representation of the SQL data should be recorded.

## Patient Extraction
Config file needs to contain the following fields:

- FlatFileDirectory - The location where the flat files generated by the data generation are.
- CodeDescriptionFile - The location where the file containing the description of all codes is.
